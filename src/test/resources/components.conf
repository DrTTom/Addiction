// Components of own project. Cannot handle parallel test packages but these are almost never part of the product.
// OK, this project is too small for showing something expressive.
// Syntax is as follows:
// - define component by putting its name in []
// - Define interfaces between components by stating '-> name' for incoming requests or alternatively '<-' for outgoing,
//   wildcard * supported, no need to define same interface twice (on both components)
// - list packages belonging to a component, one in each line-
// - comments supported, obviously
